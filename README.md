# COLOR-PREDICTOR-ML
This is a small project to identify the colors in an image!

I have added the source code and the colors dataset with a test image this code runs better on 600x200 resolution images
images more than 600 resolution gets broken into 600 resolution image,it will be updated soon were the code runs on all resolution images.
Thank you.
